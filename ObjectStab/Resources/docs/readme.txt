Hello,

Thank you for joining the ObjectStab mailing list.

The purpose of the group is to provide a forum for the distribution
of the library files, as well as the discussion of usage issues.

Feel free to post questions on the forum. I will answer any question
about the library as quickly as my (spare) time) allows.

You can now download the library files from the files section at:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/objectstab/files/Library/

If you have user-written models or teaching material using the library
that you are willing to share, please upload them to the 'Contributions' folder in the Files section. However, I cannot accept any responsibility for the material that you may find in this folders.

To install: unzip the files to the directory:
<DYMOLAHOME>\Modelica\Library\ObjectStab

You can see how a correct installation looks in the screenshot in the
file 'Installation.jpg'.

You will need a functioning Dymola installation version 4.3 or 5.0
to use the Library. If you do not yet have Dymola you can download
a demo version from:

http://www.dynasim.se/demo/

Note that with a demo version of Dymola you can only simulate the
examples included in the library.


Happy ObjectStabbing,

	Mats Larsson
